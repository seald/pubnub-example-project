# SDK example project
This project is a sandbox application made to showcase how to use PubNub with the [Seald-SDK](https://docs.seald.io/en/sdk/).

The full documentation of the Seald SDK is available [here](https://docs.seald.io/en/sdk/example/).
The one for PubNub SDK [here](https://www.pubnub.com/docs/)

## Setting up the environment
### Seald configuration 
You need to have a developer account for the Seald-SDK. If you do not have one, you may [create a trial account here](https://www.seald.io/create-sdk).

From there, you will need to get the [elements listed on the documentation](https://docs.seald.io/en/sdk/guides/1-quick-start.html#prerequisites):
- `apiURL`: URL for the API server used. In this project, it will be named `API_URL`.
- `keyStorageURL`: URL for the key storage server used. In this project, it will be named `KEY_STORAGE_URL`.
- `appId`: Unique UUID for your application. In this project, it will be named `APP_ID`.
- `validationKeyId` : unique UUID of the validation key. In this project, it will be named `VALIDATION_KEY_ID`.
- `validationKey` : secret validation key corresponding to the validationKeyId used to generate offline license tokens. In this project, it will be named `VALIDATION_KEY`.

### PubNub configuration
You need to have an account for PubNub. If you do not have one, you may [create a trial account here](https://dashboard.pubnub.com/signup).

From there, you will need to get a demo keyset with the following elements:
- Publish Key: in this project, it will be named `PUBNUB_PUB_KEY`.
- Subscribe Key: in this project, it will be named `PUBNUB_SUB_KEY`.
- Secret Key:  in this project, it will be named `PUBNUB_SECRET_KEY`.

Once you've created a key, you need to enable the `OBJECTS` options, and activate `User Metadata Events`, `Channel Metadata Events`, `Membership Events`
This can be done from your key settings in the Admin Portal.

### Creating the settings files
Using the elements retrieved both from Seald & PubNub in the two previous paragraphs, you can proceed to creating the settings files.
#### Frontend

Settings of the frontend must be set in a `./frontend/src/settings.json` file.

There is a `./frontend/src/settings.example.json` file which is a template of the `settings.json` you can copy & paste, you'll need to replace the values with the actual settings.

The following settings must be set:

| Settings               | Description         |
|------------------------|---------------------|
| `SEALD_JWT_SECRET`     | Seald JWT Secret    |
| `SEALD_JWT_SECRET_ID`  | Seald JWT Secret ID |
| `SEALD_APP_ID`         | Seald App ID        |
| `SEALD_API_URL`        | Seald API URL       |
| `SEALD_KEYSTORAGE_URL` | Seald SSKS API URL  |
| `PUBNUB_PUB_KEY`       | PubNub pub key      |
| `PUBNUB_SUB_KEY`       | PubNub sub key      |

#### Backend

Settings of the backend must be set in a `./backend/settings.json` file.

There is a `./backend/settings.example.json` which is a template of the `settings.json` you can copy & paste, you'll need to replace the values with the actual settings.

The following settings must be set:

| Settings         | Description                                       |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `HTTPS_ENABLED`  | `true` or  `false` to setup secure session cookie |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Random string used to secure session cookie       |

In addition, in production, you may want to set the `NODE_ENV` environment variable to `"production"`, to run the
`express` webserver in production mode.

## Starting the project
Once you have [configured the settings files](#creating-the-settings-files), you can start working on the project.

### Development server
To start working on the project, you need to:
- install dependencies;
- start the development servers (which both have a *watch* feature).

On the backend, it opens a server on port `4000`:
```shell
cd backend
npm install
npm start
```

On the frontend, it opens a server on port `3000`:
```shell
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

And *voil√†*!
